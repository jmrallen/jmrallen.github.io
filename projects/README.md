This screenshot demonstrates well how useful hexbins can be for analysis. The 1990s in Tajikistan and Afghanistan was a tale of two cities, and a tale of two valleys. The capitals of both countries, Dushanbe and Kabul, were the site of much fighting as rival armed groups fought for control of their nations' seats of power. The nearby river valleys of Gharm and Panjshir were the site of battles between opposition groups and state actors. While the points provide the exact location of battles and major clashes, there are some overlaps in points, especially in the Tajikistan dataset. The hexbins overcome this issue by aggregating the number of casualties. This is useful for understanding the broader trends in the data.

Collaborations and reliance on other resources: Please document any so I know what you have been able to find and what you have added. What did you learn from a peer map critique, if you did one? What did you contribute to others? What coding resources (and individuals) did you draw upon in the process of making your map, and to what effect? (Commenting in the code itself at the places in question is helpful.) 
Reflective analysis: A several-paragraph (2-3 paragraphs, revised with care; not essay-length) piece that gives the reader a discussion of the decisions that you made and the resulting insights that you think your interactive map is conveying. Some possibilities:
Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
