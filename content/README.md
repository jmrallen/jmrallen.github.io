# Content Staging

This folder is a staging area for new images and content before they are processed (resized, compressed) and placed in their final locations (e.g., `images/`, `images/thumbs/`).

## Workflow
1. Drop raw images/content here
2. Process (compress, resize) as needed
3. Move to final location
4. Delete from this folder
